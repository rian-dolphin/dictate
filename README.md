# Vibevoice üéôÔ∏è

Hi, I'm [Marc P√§pper](https://x.com/mpaepper) and I wanted to vibe code like [Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) ;D, so I looked around and found the cool work of [Vlad](https://github.com/vlad-ds/whisper-keyboard). I extended it to run with a local whisper model, so I don't need to pay for OpenAI tokens.
I hope you have fun with it!

## What it does üöÄ

![Demo Video](docs/vibevoice-demo-caption.gif)

Simply run `cli.py` and start dictating text anywhere in your system:
1. Hold down right control key (Ctrl_r)
2. Speak your text

4. Watch as your spoken words are transcribed and automatically typed!

Works in any application or window - your text editor, browser, chat apps, anywhere you can type!

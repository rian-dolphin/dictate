# Dictate üéôÔ∏è

Simple voice-to-text dictation for macOS that runs on Apple Silicon.

## What it does

Hold right option key, speak, release - your words get transcribed and typed wherever your cursor is.

Note that if you move the cursor or change windows before transcription completes then it will be pasted wherever the cursor is upon finishing.

## Installation & Usage

Follow the commands below to run. The initial run might involve:
- Downloading the model which will take a couple mins
- You will be prompted to allow accessibility settings for audio input permissions etc. This may require you to restart the terminal after.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rian-dolphin/dictate.git
cd dictate
uv run src/dictate/cli.py
```

## Requirements
